# SupRailroad
SupRailroad is providing a PoC for a solution designed to be used by all of the transportation company's customers. With
this new era of technology, the company wants to abandon the old paper ticket and provide a complete solution that allows
people to order discount cards but also tickets. This solution must be based on blockchain technology because it must be
used by all companies in Europe and not only in France.
